Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors the driver's face for signs of drowsiness.
Alert System: Triggers an alert when drowsiness is detected.
Machine Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models for face and eye detection.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Dlib
Scipy
Imutils

Usage
1.Run the Detection Script: 
  python detect_drowsiness.py

2.Interface:

The script will open your webcam and start monitoring for drowsiness.
An alert will be triggered if drowsiness is detected.
